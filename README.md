# The Effects of Data Imputation on Covariance and Inverse Covariance Matrix Estimation

This repo contains scripts to reproduce the experiment results in the paper:

"The Effects of Data Imputation on Covariance and Inverse Covariance Matrix Estimation",
published in IEEE Access
# Preparation
## Libraries
Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install fancyimpute
pip install DistributedMissForest
pip install MissForest
```
## Dataset
The four datasets we use are from "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/" and are automatically collected in the code.

# Our results
We visualize some results of the comparison in ...

We also experiment to verify the main theorem in ...

# Usage
The notebooks are created by Google's Colaboratory and can be run online with Colab
The used dataset of each notebook is described in its title.  

## References and contact
