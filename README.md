# The Effects of Data Imputation on Covariance and Inverse Covariance Matrix Estimation

This repository contains scripts to reproduce the experiment results in the paper:

"The Effects of Data Imputation on Covariance and Inverse Covariance Matrix Estimation,"
published in the journal IEEE Access
# Preparation
## Libraries
Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install fancyimpute
pip install DistributedMissForest
pip install MissForest
```
## Dataset
We use the four datasets from "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/" and they are automatically collected in the code.

# Our results
We visualize some results of the comparison in Figure/Figures.ipynb

We also experiment to verify the main theorem in Figure/The figure for verifying the main theorem.ipynb

# Usage
The notebooks are created by Google's Colaboratory and can be run online with Colab
The dataset used for each notebook is described in its title.
